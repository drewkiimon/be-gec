# Global Entry Checher BE

## What is this?

The Global Entry Checker (GEC) is a took created by myself (Andrew Pagan) to fix the headache of looking at the government website to find a global entry appointment. It was way too many clicks, and just annoying to operate. I continue to work on the project for fun, and to see what else I can add that would make the website useful for others. If you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear it.
